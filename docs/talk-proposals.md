# Documentation: Talk Proposals

This document explains how the LGM 2016 talk proposals are handled

##Â Submitting the proposal

A talk submission form has been created (using the WordPress plugin *Formidable*).

What happens when a talk proposal gets submitted:

1. A **message** is displayed after the form is submitted (defined under *Formidable > Forms > LGM 2016 Proposal Submissions > Settings > General*)
3. The form gets saved to the database, entries can be seen under *Formidable > Entries*.
4. **Create Talk:** A new "Talk" (custom post type) is created, and populated with the information from the submission form.
2. **Email to Site Admin:** a notification email gets sent after each talk submission.
6. **Email to Submitter:** The newly registered user receives an email notification. 

Those actions are defined under *Formidable > Forms > "LGM 2016 Proposal Submissions" > Settings > Form Actions*

# Documentation: the Speaker role:

Features of the custom Speaker role:

- The Speaker can log in and add some information, edit the discription, add tags/keywords, add slides.
- The Speaker has limited capacities, so when the "Speaker" logs into the LGM site, she sees only her own talk.

##Â Can I see the code?

Everything is [happening in this file](https://github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/htdocs-2016/blob/master/plugins/lgm-talks-2016/lgm-user-roles.php).

Note that the add_role() part is commented out, because it needs to run only once.
